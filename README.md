Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the most prevalent diseases that affects the health of millions of people. We aimed to develop predictive models to identify risk factors for heart disease, which could help facilitate early diagnosis and intervention and reduce medical costs. Recently, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data has been used to predict type 2 diabetes, obesity, etc.…. In this project, we analyzed the most up-to-date cross-sectional data on 437436 participants from BRFSS (https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2018.html). We will present several machine learning models for predicting heart disease, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random forest. We used R software version 3.5.1 (R Foundation) to preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis, and apply machine learning techniques. Consequently, the efficiency of machine learner are evaluated using metric such as accuracy, kappa statistic, and stability.
